## Overview

This job simulation is with one of Tata Group's companies, Tata Insights and Quants or Tata iQ. I gained insight into how our passionate multi-disciplinary experts solve some of the most complex business problems using data visualisation solutions, such as Tableau and Power BI and create amazing stories which are hidden under the mountains of data generated. 

## Task 1 : Thinking from the perspective of business leaders

An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.

## Questions from the CEO and CMO

On the basis of this [**Dataset**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OnFXDcydpqhSUbFt6XYV1ebClkvexNe2FcqJjwbs6FA/edit?usp=sharing) the CEO and CMO have asked a few questions which we as a Data Analyst have to answer.

- Which region is generating the highest revenue, and which region is generating the lowest?
- What is the monthly trend of revenue, which months have faced the biggest increase/decrease?
- Which months generated the most revenue? Is there a seasonality in sales?
- Who are the top customers and how much do they contribute to the total revenue? Is the business dependent on these customers or is the customer base diversified?
- What is the percentage of customers who are repeating their orders? Are they ordering the same products or different?
- For the repeat customers, how long does it take for them to place the next order after being delivered the previous one?
- What revenue is being generated from the customers who have ordered more than once?
- Who are the customers that have repeated the most? How much are they contributing to revenue?

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
- [**Cleaned Data**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lmp3iSW8OC9Hkw89tKKwiSGD65tlvWLL67f3211cqPw/edit?usp=sharing) - This file consists of the basic data cleaning done in google sheets such as removing nulls and duplicates. This file is sufficient to answer the CEO's questions.
- [**Repeat Customer Data**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19XEK8iDI__eNNuraz3JhjCBHrrRHeAMzeWy5ZCpGVwY/edit?usp=sharing) - As the data provided in this simulation does not have customer classification. I have done the customer classification in Python which can be found [**Here**](https://github.com/Karanarora274/Tata-Data-Analysis-and-Visualisation/blob/main/Tata%20Forage.ipynb).

## Key Insights

The analysis generated key insights, including:
- The highest revenue is in the month of November.
- The top customer as per revenue is 14646.
- The most quantity of products is sold in Netherlands.
- France has the most revenue.
- The most reordered item is Regency Cakestand 3 Tier.
- On an average reorders are done on the same day.
- 95.02% of revenue comes from repeat customers.
- 18% revenue comes from the top customer 14646.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Google Sheets**: For data cleaning.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For creating the repeat customer classification.
- **Tableau**: For Data Visualisation.
- **Canva**: For preparing the presentation slides.
- **Loom**: For recording the video presentation.

## Conclusion

The Tata Forage Job Simulation provided a valuable opportunity to experience real-world tasks in a professional setting. Throughout the simulation, I applied critical business and data analysis skills to solve industry-relevant challenges, gaining insights into Tataâ€™s approach to problem-solving and decision-making. The simulation enhanced my understanding of key concepts like data-driven strategies, process optimization, and effective communication of findings.

By completing this program, I am now better equipped to tackle complex problems and contribute meaningfully to similar roles in the future. This experience has strengthened my ability to translate data into actionable insights and present them in a clear, concise manner.
