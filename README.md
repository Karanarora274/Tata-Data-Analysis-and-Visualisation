## Overview

This repository contains the work completed during the **Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation** on Forage in October 2024. The project involved advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst. I worked with CSV files related to content, reactions, and reaction types to analyze trends and provide strategic recommendations, including data sampling and modeling.

## Project Deliverables

Key activities and deliverables include:
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and organized the datasets using **Google Sheets** to remove inconsistencies and prepare them for analysis.
- **Data Sampling**: Applied data sampling techniques to ensure the datasets were representative and manageable for analysis.
- **Data Analysis & Modeling**: Performed analysis in Google Sheets to uncover key insights into content performance, user reactions, and engagement trends. Created models to better understand relationships between variables and forecast outcomes.
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Created charts and visual representations of the analysis in **Google Sheets** and **Google Slides**.
- **Presentation**: Developed a slide deck in Google Slides and recorded a **video presentation using Loom** to communicate the findings to the client and internal stakeholders.

## Datasets

The project utilized three main datasets:
1. [**Content CSV**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N-_B8HplRutpN21tMskid_IQNKun9mDwYaG7-o7AKws/edit?gid=820542644#gid=820542644) - Information on various content types posted on the platform.
2. [**Reactions CSV**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mqYULie6EcRahumjnn7P1d8rcjBFJDGg3kEHv6a4dJk/edit?usp=sharing) - Data on user interactions with the content.
3. [**Reaction Types CSV**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMmFYPKTk-SoPDIT5d24nfgixqJ5irz29pbjUf6CpEI/edit?usp=sharing) - Categorization of different reaction types (e.g., likes, comments, shares).

## Final Analysis File
- [**Final Analysis File**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b8UiwEF812rfnloRWbbFvG4xXhDG_ljOJYJCzvnIpc8/edit?gid=971338287#gid=971338287)

## Key Insights

The analysis generated key insights, including:
- Identification of content types that drive the highest engagement.
- Insights into how users react to different types of content.
- Data modeling to predict content performance based on reactions and other metrics.
- Summary on improving content strategies based on user reaction patterns and the model's predictions.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Google Sheets**: For data cleaning, sampling, analysis, modeling, and creating visual charts.
- **Google Slides**: For preparing the presentation slides.
- **Loom**: For recording the video presentation.

## Slide Deck and Video

- [Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IDl1LN85aYuKcyQTnlRq6NedVUP-qq1Ryo4cKXC_RYY/edit#slide=id.p1) - Google Slides presentation summarizing the analysis.
